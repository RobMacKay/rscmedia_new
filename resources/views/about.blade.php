                <h1>Where it all began...</h1>
                <p>In 2018, against the breathtaking backdrop of the North East of Scotland, RSC Media was born from Rob
                    MacKay's profound commitment to demystifying the internet for businesses. With a rich history dating
                    back to 1998 when Rob embarked on his web development journey, the company's foundation rests on a
                    wealth of experience and an enduring passion for the digital realm.</p>

                <p>Before founding RSC Media, Rob spent years as a web development freelancer, refining his skills and
                    gaining insights into the intricate world of the internet. His journey took him across the Atlantic
                    to contribute to the dynamic tech environment at Copter Labs in the United States.</p>

                <p>The creation of RSC Media was fueled by a deep desire to guide businesses through the mysteries of
                    the internet. Rob envisioned a company that not only delivers cutting-edge web solutions but also
                    provides valuable advice and consultation based on years of experience. RSC Media stands as a
                    beacon, offering a friendly and knowledgeable hand to companies navigating the complexities of the
                    digital landscape.</p>

                <p>At RSC Media, we don't just offer services; we share a wealth of expertise gained over decades. Our
                    mission is clear â€” to empower businesses with tailored solutions and insightful consultation. Join
                    Rob MacKay and the RSC Media team as we continue to unravel the mysteries of the internet for
                    businesses, ensuring a digital presence that stands the test of time.</p>
